# How it Started
I started this project a couple years back when subdomain takeovers were on rise and primarily developed it for the enumeration of subdomains by combining online search, existing tools and brute-force where i can supply multiple wordlists and the tool would combine the lists to create a single one. 

Now, its a complete scanning tool that can help you identify potential problems for a domain. For most of the part its automated and has a User Interface to run and manage concurrent sessions. It can be levaraged in bug bounty, infosec, and devsecops as well. 

# Subrake
