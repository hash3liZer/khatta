## Introduction
In the AmateursCTF 2023, there was a challenge by the name `Sanity`. Now, i wasn't able to solve the challenge within the due time as i got stuck on the very last step of my Proof of Concept. Neverthless, i feel like writing the writeup for this one. Besides from CTF perspective, it covers vulnerabilities that can can be discovered in the wild on Internet.

Coming soon...
